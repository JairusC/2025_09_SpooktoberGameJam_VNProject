    """
    The room is unkempt, clothes all over the place. Lee sees her partner lying on his side, his face turned away. 

    He is still wearing the same clothes from the funeral this morning and left his shoes on he fell asleep. 
    
    He was half way to tucking himself in but clearly gave up and just threw the sheets aside.

    Lee gently pulls the sheets over him and lies down, caressing his cheeks. She marks the bends and curves of his face.

    She shuts her eyes and focuses on him. Her partner of 20 years and the one who has been with her at her highest and lowest.
    
    Without too much struggle, she can feel her mind blending into his.

    "Here they are, at the start of the battle. A long drawn out one that started from the most inconspicuous location. A little apartment by the side of town. One that they moved into a few years ago to give <their child> her own room."

    p "Lee...?"

    l "(My hair was still damp from the shower - I hated drying my hair if I didn’t have anything else happening that day. A weird hill to stand on, I admit, and I can sometimes see it in his eyes, thinking the same. He never says anything though. I don’t think he will get it, he has only ever had a short buzz since I have known him.)"

    l "Yeah?"

    "She only just realises that he hasn’t seen him like this in a while. She is not sure how long it has been, or how unsettling it might be."

    l "(He is just as quiet as he was during the hospital visits.)"

    l "(Can he tell this is a dream?)"

    p "..."

    p "I remember this... The Sunday... <Child> is still at her swimclass."

    l "What else do you remember?"

    p "You... You are going to get up after lunch and put away the dishes. And you're going to trip."

    p "We thought it was just a little slip so we didn't bother with a check up or anything. I put it to the back of my mind for so long..."

    p "If I made you go do a check up..."

    l "It's not on you. It wasn't really our thing, going to the doctors"

    "She rests her head on his shoulder and takes his hand. Without a second thought, she wraps her fingers tightly around his and gives them a squeeze."
    
    "One of the few things she remembers from his visits were the hours he spent sitting silently by her, holding her hand. He had gotten into habit into telling her about his day, which oddly enough they did not do a lot before."

    "Now at last, she is the one leading. Perks of being dead and unconcerned."

    l "Do you also remember what we ate for lunch that day?"

    "His eyes widens and he falls into his typical thinking pose, leaning back, folding his arms and scratching his chin."

    l "(He is going to start tapping his foot soon.)"

    "She leaves and brings back a few plates. <Insert food>"

    l "Have you been eating well?"

    p "I tried... It is just easier to cook what <child> wants."

    l "She is a little picky. Did you not get bored?"

    p "She actually started eating a lot more..."

    p "She says she needs to eat a lot to grow taller and start helping around the house."

    l "I am sorry I wasn't there"

    "She nudges him to start eating."

    p "She was still asking where you were until a few days ago. She really wanted to see you... But I just couldn't bring her with me."

    l "But she would have..."

    p "Would have understood? She is only ten! I didn't know how to tell her you were breaking apart, or that you might never come home again. How was I supposed to explain why you were just skin and bones?"

    p "I didn't want her to remember you like that..."

    "He is right. I was sick. It hurt a lot, but it hurt him too. Through sickness and health was a promise and he's proven time and time again that he lives by that."

    "When dad was counting down, mum was the one who looked after him. She told me it was okay, that <child> was young and she needed me. I was barely there and I only got to see him at the end. I never saw the hurting and I don’t think mum ever got over it."

    l "..."

    p "No no, I should have done a better job... I should have taken her to see you."

    l "Did you think it was going to end up like this? When I ended up in the hospital?"

    p "Of course not! We thought it was just something small… Something you would shake off after a week."

    l "It ended up hurting us both for a long time."

    p "You were the one hurting the most."

    l "Doesn't change how much it hurt you."

    "He looks at her wistfully."

    l "Would it have been better for you, if I let do earlier?"

    "He jumps from his seat, ripping him away from Lee. His brows arches. He hesistates to speak again."

    "Lee doesn't say another word. Like the few times they have fought, she beckons him meekly to sit down again and lays a kiss on his forehead, sending him into deeper sleep."
