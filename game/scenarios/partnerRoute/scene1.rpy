    """
    The room is unkempt, clothes all over the place. Lee sees her partner lying on his side, his face turned away. 

    He is still wearing the same clothes from the funeral this morning, and seems to have left his shoes on when he fell asleep. 
    
    It looks like he was halfway to tucking himself in, but clearly gave up and just threw the sheets aside.

    Lee gently pulls the sheets over him and lies down, caressing his cheeks. She marks the bends and curves of his face.

    Her partner of 20 years, and the one who has been with her at her highest and lowest.
    
    He murmurs under his breath - it seems like he's dreaming. She shuts her eyes and focuses on him. Without too much struggle, she can feel her mind blending into his.

    "She joins him in his dreams and finds herself back where their long, uphill battle began: a little apartment on the outskirts of town. They'd moved in a few years ago to give <their child> her own room."

    p "Lee...?"

    l "(It seems my hair is damp. Maybe from the shower - I used to hate drying my hair if I didn’t have anything else happening that day. A weird hill to die on, I admit. Sometimes, I can tell from the look in his eyes that he thinks it's weird too. He never says anything though. I don't think he ever really got it, since he's always had the same short buzz ever since we met.)"

    l "Yeah?"

    "She realises suddenly that he looks younger, just like he did when they'd first gotten the apartment, as if they've been taken back in time. She wonders if she appears younger to him, too, and thinks to herself that they haven't seen each other like this in a long time. She is not sure exactly how long it has been, or how unsettling it might be."

    l "(But he's just as quiet as he always was during the hospital visits.)"

    l "(Can he tell this is a dream?)"

    p "..."

    p "I remember this... Sunday... <Child> was still at her swimclass."

    l "(It seems that he realizes that this is an old memory, if not a dream.)"

    l "What else do you remember?"

    p "This was the day that you got up after lunch to put away the dishes... And you tripped."

    p "We'd thought it was just a little slip so we didn't bother with a check up or anything. I'd put it to the back of my mind for so long..."

    p "If only I'd made you go do a check up..."

    l "It's not on you. It wasn't really our thing, going to the doctor."

    "He sits down on their old, small couch, looking dazed."

    "She joins him and rests her head on his shoulder, taking his hand. Instinctively, she wraps her fingers tightly around his and gives them a comforting squeeze."
    
    "Her memory towards the end was hazy, but one of the few things she remembers from his visits were the hours he spent sitting silently by her, holding her hand. He had gotten into the habit of telling her about his day in detail, a habit that he hadn't developed until after she was hospitalized."

    "He'd always taken initiative in those conversations. Now, she is the one leading."

    l "Do you remember what we ate for lunch that day?"

    "His eyes widen, distracted. He leans back, folding his arms."

    l "(He is going to start tapping his foot soon.)"

    "As if on cue, his left foot slowly picks up and rests on the floor again. She cracks a smile."

    "She stands up and crosses over to the modest kitchen counter, where she'd always placed dishes when she'd finished cooking."
    
    "Despite his gap in memory, his dream seems faithful to her memory - she sees a few plates of <Insert food>, prepared just the way she always made it."

    l "Have you been eating well lately, Tommy? Since I'm... no longer around to cook, I mean."

    p "...I try. It's just easier to cook what <child> wants, and usually, she just wants her favorites."

    "Lee laughs and picks up two plates, dutifully tucks utensils on top, and brings them to him where he still sits. He's still leaned back on the couch, but his foot has stilled. He looks at her with a steadfast gaze."

    l "Yes, she's always been a little picky like that. Don't you ever get bored, eating the same thing all the time?"

    p "Sometimes. Though recently, she's actually been eating a lot more than usual, so I'm just trying to keep up. It's nice not to have to cook new things when I have to cook such large portions."

    p "She says she needs to eat a lot to grow taller, so she can help more around the house."

    "He pauses, and looks down at the plate she's handed to him. He takes it but doesn't pick up his utensils. She can't read the expression on his face."

    "Lee looks back at her husband. She takes in his downturned mouth, the exhaustion resting in his eyes, and feels a lump form in her throat. She swallows it back."

    l "I'm so, so sorry I can't be there for you both anymore."

    "She nudges him to start eating, but he still doesn't move."

    p "You know, she was still asking where you were until just a few days ago. She really wanted to see you... But I just couldn't bring her with me."

    l "But she would have..."

    "His head snaps back up, startling her."

    p "Would have what? Would have understood? She's only five! I didn't know how to tell her that you were never coming home again. How was I supposed to explain why you were just skin and bones at the end, make her look in the casket at her mother like that?"

    p "I... didn't want her to remember you like that..."

    p "*I* didn't want to remember you like that."

    "Lee startles."
    
    l "(It hurt so much when I was sick, but I didn't realize how much it must have hurt him, too. Through sickness and health was a promise, and he's proven time and time again that he lives by that, always showing up strong for me whenever he came to see me in the hospital."

    l "(Did I take that strength for granted?)"

    l "(When my own dad's health started to decline all those years ago, my mum was the one who looked after him. She always told me it was okay, that <child> was young and she needed me. I was barely there for them, and I only really got to see him at the end."
    
    l "(I never saw the full extent of his suffering, but I didn't see how much she must have been hurting, too. I don’t think mum ever truly got over it."

    l "..."

    l "(There's so much I'm only now realizing...)"

    "Tommy seems to take her silence as hurt, and guilt flashes in his eyes. He sets the plate down on the coffee table and takes her hands in his."

    p "No, no. I'm sorry, Lee. I should have done a better job as a father, as a husband... I should have taken her to see you."

    "Lee shakes her head. Again, she squeezes his hands, this time unsure who is comforting who."

    l "Did you ever think that things were going to end up like this? Back when I first had to go to the hospital?"

    p "Of course not! We'd always thought it was just something small… Something you would shake off after a week."

    l "It ended up hurting us both for a long time."

    p "You were the one in the hospital. You were hurting the most."

    l "Doesn't change how much it hurt you."

    "He looks at her wistfully. She feels a strange feeling welling up as she meets his gaze."

    "Sudednly, Lee feels words spilling out before she even realizes what she's saying."

    l "Would things have been better for you, if I'd just let go earlier?"

    "Tommy jumps up from his seat, ripping away from Lee. His brows are raised in shock, his mouth opening but not speaking."

    "Lee doesn't say another word. Just as she always did the few times they fought in the past, she meekly beckons him to her."

    "Wordless, he sits down again, still unable to respond. The silence stretches on between them, heavier with each passing moment."
    
    "Unsure, Lee leans in and lays a gentle kiss on his forehead, ending the dream and sending him into deeper sleep."
