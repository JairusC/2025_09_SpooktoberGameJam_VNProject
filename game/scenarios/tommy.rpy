    """
    Our bedroom is a mess, clothes all over the place.

    Tommy is lying on his side, turned away from me.

    I can see a glass of water and some scattered pills on the dresser by him.

    He's still wearing his day clothes. His favorite jacket that I got him years ago has been tossed to the floor.

    I kept telling him to get it tailored. He'd always just laugh, saying that the bagginess suited him just fine.
    
    He wanted to keep it exactly the way I got it.
    
    I wish he'd liked that one scarf I knitted for him just as much as he did the jacket.

   	He didn't even bother to kick his shoes off before jumping onto the bed. The sheets barely cover him, a half-hearted attempt to tuck himself in.

    My heart aches at the sight.

    I tug at the sheets and unexpectedly manage to pull them over him.

    Oh, so I can touch this? Then, maybe…

    I push at the mattress and, emboldened by its familiar bounce, lie down next to him. 
    
    I still can't touch him, but I meekly trace the side of his face with my hand. The bends and curves have seen better days.

    I know exactly what caused those wrinkles. It's the same thing that caused those pronounced eyebags: too many days of too little sleep. 
    
    The sunken, pale cheeks from skipping meals.
    
    He mutters in his sleep, seemingly stuck in a dream.
