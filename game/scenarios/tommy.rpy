    """
    Our bedroom is a mess, clothes all over the place.

    Tommy is lying on his side, turned away from me.

    I can see a glass of water and some scattered pills on the dresser by him.

    He is still wearing his day clothes. His favorite jacket that I got him years ago has been tossed to the floor.

    I kept telling him to get it tailored. He'd always just laugh, saying that the bagginess suited him just fine.
    
    He wanted to keep it exactly the way I got it.
    
    I wish he'd liked that one scarf I knitted for him just as much as he did the jacket.

   	He didn't even bother to kick his shoes off before jumping onto the bed. The sheets barely cover him, a half-hearted attempt to tuck himself in.

    My heart aches at the sight.

    I tug at the sheets and unexpectedly manage to pull them over him.
    """

    l "Oh, so I can touch this? Then, maybe…"

    """
    I push at the mattress and, emboldened by its familiar bounce, lie down next to him. 
    
    I still can't touch him, but I meekly trace the side of his face with my hand. The bends and curves have seen better days.

    I know exactly what caused those wrinkles. It's the same thing that caused those pronounced eyebags: too many days of too little sleep. 
    
    The sunken, pale cheeks from skipping meals.
    
    He mutters in his sleep, seemingly stuck in a dream.

    "As if in an act of prayer, I close my eyes and fold my hands together."
    l "{i}Tommy. My husband, and the one who shared with me ten years of highs, lows and the mundane valleys in between.{/i}"
    l "{i}They were the best days of our lives.{/i}"
    "I can feel a pull. The longer I spend thinking about him, the stronger it is. Not a single part of my being resists."
    "It is a familiar feeling. The same warmth I felt when he would hold my hand."
    "..."
    "I don't know how, but when I open my eyes again, we're no longer in our bedroom."
    "Instead, he is fast asleep on my lap, like he'd been there all along."

    "I can't resist playing with his hair a little before taking in our surroundings."
    "We are sitting on the couch in our first apartment."
    "The place that we scouted out just weeks after we finished our final exams. By then, we had been together for three years."

    "I remember our first weekend here. Our boxes were unopened and the fridge had just been installed."
    "We didn't have a single clue what we were going to make for dinner."
    "But we didn't care."
    "Back then, we were naive and brave enough to think that we could figure it all out as we went, as long as we had each other."
    "Tommy rubs his eyes and yawns lightly. He sheepishly gets up."
    t "Lee...?"
    "I mouth a silent hello to him."
    t "How…?"
    "I shrug."
    l "Your guess is as good as mine."
    "Confused, he looks back and forth between me and the rest of the apartment."
    t "We're here… You're here..."
    "He lunges at me and pulls me into a tight embrace. A desperately tight hug that catches me by surprise."
    "I can feel a slight tremble around my left shoulder, and dampness from his tears starting to gather. I reach for his back and gently massage it."
    l "You forgot to take your shoes off, huh?"
    t "Argh come on, don't make that the first thing you say to me."
    l "You know we're an Asian household, right?"
    "He lets out a light chuckle."
    #suggest removing this line
    #t "Second generation removed (temporary)"
    "We both laugh."

    # this might be too 'young' for the couple - we will need to review this
    t "Growing up, our families always had this playful banter going on. It was like a competition to see who could come up with the most ridiculous excuses for not doing chores."
    l "Right? Like when your mom would say she couldn't do the laundry because it was 'too heavy'?"
    t "Or when my dad claimed he was 'too busy' to help with dinner because he was 'working on his novel.'"
    l "Which was really just him playing video games."
    t "Exactly! And we thought we could outsmart them by using the same excuses."
    "Those were good times."
    #adding a pause here for effect
    "..."
    t "I've missed being silly like this."
    l "I guess it's been hard to be silly lately."
    t "Mmm…"

    "I stay still and let the hug continue. I can feel the warmth radiating off him, and I can feel his breath on my skin."
    "I've missed this, even if he's a slobbering mess."
    "Now that I have my arms around him, he feels skinnier."

    l "Have you been eating...?"
    t "Hmm? Ah, well..."

    l "Haven't had the appetite with the funeral and everything, you know?"

    l "Oh…"

    t "It's nothing compared to what you went through."

    l "No… I put you through so much, and for so long."

    l "You basically lived at the hospital for a whole year and a half."

    t "It was the least I could do."

    l "It was too much."

    l "Once upon a time, I would have relented. But… something tells me I won't have another chance to do this."

    l "I know you don't want to talk about it, but I want to know… I need to know..."

    "I let go of him and try to elicit some reaction from him."

    l "I need to know what you went through."

    "His eyes drift away, trying to hide whatever he's thinking about from me."

    "I let him take his time."

    t "We promised to be there for each other in sickness and in health. And honestly… I know I meant it when I said it."

    t "But I don't think I was truly prepared for the ‘in sickness' part."

    t "I never could have imagined what that would really be like..."

    t "I spent every moment of those hospital visits wishing that I had spent more time with you."

    t "I could have come home a bit earlier, skipped work functions."
    t "There are so many minutes I wish I could claw back to spend with you."

    t "If I had spent more time with you, paid more attention, maybe we would have seen the warning signs and none of this would have happened."

    l "I... I wish it never did. But..."

    "I think back to the years we'd spent together."

    l "Even though that's it for us, you gave me so many perfect moments. I don't want to change any of them."

    l "We just… We just can't make more…"

    "..."

    t "We had so many things we were going to do."

    l "{i}I know.{/i}"

    t "We were going to visit your friends that year."

    l "{i}That would have been so fun.{/i}"

    t "I was so close to getting us a dog."

    l "{i}We would have been the best dog parents.{/i}"

    "He pauses for a moment, his eyes glued to mine and widened."

    t "I… I think I'm missing a future we don't get to have."

    "I put my arm around him and squeeze."

    l "I left everything hanging by a thread when I got sick."

    l "But at the same time, there must have been so many things you stopped doing because of me."
    l "That book you were writing, dungeons and whatever with your friends... all those things that you put on pause to help take care of me..." 
    l "Maybe now, you can do them again?"

    "We sit in silence. I think he's taking it in."

    l "You'll be doing it for me too."

    #since it looks like the line about lee predicting tommy will tap his foot is removed, it feels awkward that he starts tapping his foot and scratching his chin -- it's kinda cartoonish i feel like??
    "He scratches his chin."

    "He seems uncomfortable, but I can tell he's giving my words real consideration."

    t "Okay."

    l "{i}Knowing him, whatever he decides to do, he will put his full being into it.{/i}"

    l "{i}Without me{/i}."
