    Feels like I just woke up from a really, really long nap…  I haven't felt so myself in so long…
    
    Not only that, I know exactly where I am. Somewhere I didn't think I would see again. 
    
    The very same living room that Tommy and I used to eat dinner in. 
    
    The same room where I would make him sleep in after we fight.
    
    Where I slipped that one time and the problems began.
