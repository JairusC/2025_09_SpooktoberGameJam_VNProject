    Feels like I just woke up from a really, really long nap…  I haven't felt so myself in so long…
    
    Not only that, I know exactly where I am. Somewhere I didn't think I would see again. 
    
    The very same living room that Tommy and I used to eat dinner in. 
    
    The same room I'd make him sleep in after a fight.
    
    The same room where one day, I slipped, and the problems began.

    "Tommy! He was right beside me..." 
    "Where is he..."
    "I can't remember it all but the doctor and nurses rushed in and were all over me in a second."
    "Tommy losing his grip when they kicked him out of the room…"
    "I can see the dozens of fridge magnets we got on our trips. The photo of us from a few Christmases ago."
    "The books lined up on the shelf that Tommy promised he would finish."
    "But if I'm home now, then surely I'm okay?"
    "No. That's not possible… I didn't..."
    "Tommy couldn't even look at me anymore. It got so bad that they stopped updating me."

    "Do I just stay here forever?"
    "The possibility of an eternal afterlife alone terrifies me. I need to distract myself, immediately."
    "The panic eats at my chest." 
    "I bury my face in my hands and quietly beg."
    "Tommy… I need to see Tommy..."

    "I look up. The grip around my chest loosens."
    "There he is."
    "I'm more grateful than ever that he is here. Yet, I can't help but be taken back."
    "Tommy had always kept a simple look. He preferred a clean shave and he kept a close eye on his hair, making sure it never grew too long."
    "Instead, the man that stumbled in has a patchy beard, with hair growing beyond his brows. His eye bags are huge and pronounced."
    "How did I not notice this before, when he visited me at the hospital?"
    "I draw a blank trying to recall his face in the days leading up to my death."
    "I reach out for his arm, but it passes right through him."
    "Tommy marches clumsily towards the bedroom, out of sight."
    "I don't understand. How can I not touch him?"
    "Am I just going to be here for eternity, and he'll never know I'm here?"
